Mechanical engineer and automobile enthusiast striving to satiate the desire to change the world, one spline at a time. 
Currently pursuing Mechanical Engineering in Delhi Technological University (formerly Delhi College of Engineering). 
Ex-powertrain engineer, Cost Co-lead and Electrical Department Lead from Team Defianz Racing with 2.5 years of FSAE experience.
Proficient at Solidworks, Fusion360, Ansys, Ricardo WAVE, StarCCM+, Femap with NX NASTRAN, Python, and more so in verbal skills and technical communication with experience in other simulation softwares like OpenFOAM through Windows subsystem for Linux(WSL), Femap and Icepak.
Currently attempting to carve a path to the Aerospace Engineering spectrum. I find that the sole crucial difference between a fully skilled engineer and an unskilled apprentice is the knowledge of self worth and the potential to see perspective.
